        <!--To have the status bar translucent and have our drawer slide over it, we need to set android:windowTranslucentStatus to true. Because this style is not available for pre Kitkat devices, we'll add res/values-v19/styles.xml file for API version 19 and onwards. Note: If you modify your res/values/styles.xml directly with this android:windowTranslucentStatus line, you are likely to need to build only for SDK versions 19 or higher, which will obviously limit you from supporting many older devices.-->
